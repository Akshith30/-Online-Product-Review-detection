This project detects and analyzes extremist reviewer groups in online marketplaces like Amazon. Such groups post highly positive or negative reviews collectively to promote or harm brands. Reviews are collected and grouped using frequent itemset mining based on brand similarities. Eight behavioral and content-based features are extracted for each group–brand pair. A supervised model, with a three-layer perceptron classifier performing best, identifies extremist groups. The study also examines patterns in ratings, sentiments, verified purchases, and review timelines to understand opinion spam behavior.
